            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that helps keep track of changes between files and sets of files.  By using a centralize version control system it allows for multiple users to work on the same project or file simultaneously. The system also allows for the user to revert back to previous versions and to resolve conflicts between differnt users.</p>

            <p class="lead">
Git is one type of distributive version control system. It was developed by the Linux community, especially Linus Torvalds to replace BitKeeper when it was no longer free to use. The system, unlike other VCSs, takes a snap shot of the entire project instead of simply keeping track of the changes. Git was developed with the goals of speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, to be fully distributed and able to handle large project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distriuted version controls rely on a local and remote repository.  When using system like Git, all most all of the work is done localy and then pushed to the remote repository.  This allows for offline work to be done almost anywhere and makes it almost impossible for the system to fail.  Local Repositories can be created in two ways, either by creating a brand new one or by copying a remove repository onto your local machine.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different Git commands and they can be executed at a command line prompt or via a GUI.  Among the most imporant basic Git commands are Add, Commit and Push.  Its through this process of Adding content to the staging area, Commiting it to the local repository so that its tracked and then Pushing it to the remote repository that Git is able to keep track of everything.  When using the Commit command you are required to offer comments or notes so that others will understand what is going on.  There are also commands such as Log and Status that help the user understand what's happening with the repsitory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
Git uses a SHA-1 hash checksumming process.  This is a 40 character long set of hexadecimal characfers calculates based on the contents of a file or directory.  It fact GIT uses these valuse instead of file names to store the data in the database.  By using this process its impossible to change the contents of a file or direcltoru without Git knowing about it.</p>
